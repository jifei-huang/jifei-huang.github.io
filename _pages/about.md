I am an incoming PhD student at UW-Madison majoring experimental condensed matter physics physics. After graduating from
[National Unversity of Singapore](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/), where I specialized in the dynamics of chiral magnetism, I will transition to research on the emerging fields of two-dimensional magnetism and twistronics.
